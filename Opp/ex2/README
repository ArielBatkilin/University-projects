SpaceShip.java - this class is the base class for all the ships. the only two methods that the ships may override is the
  "doAction" method, and the "getImage" method.
SpaceShipAggressive.java - the aggressive spaceship class that extends the regular SpaceShip class
SpaceShipBasher.java -  the basher spaceship class that extends the regular SpaceShip class
SpaceShipDrunkard.java - the drunk spaceship class that extends the regular SpaceShip class
SpaceShipFactory.java - the class that constract the ships
SpaceShipHuman.java -  the human spaceship class that extends the regular SpaceShip class
SpaceShipRunner.java - the runner spaceship class that extends the regular SpaceShip class
SpaceShipSpaciel.java - the spacial spaceship class that extends the regular SpaceShip class

I chose to disign of a basic class for space ships that implements almost all of 
the spaceships functions, and the specific spaceships are extending this class and 
basicly override only the do action method (exept the human spaceships that also override
the getImage method). i chose that disign because i notice that praticly all the methods
are similliar to all the space ships, except the do action method. the onlyt thing that left to do
is to override that method and that what makes the difference bitween the spaceships.
I also built a classes for the health, and the energy, and made instances of those classes as
the ships data members. i decided to do that because there are alot of rols in the health and the energy
and that means alot of methods that if i made them in the spaceships class, it would have made the class
not with only one porpose.
it's very easy to create new types of spaceships because all left to do is to implement a new
doAction method. 
all the behavior of the ships is done with constants that can be easely changed.

so we have the game (instance of ShipWars)
the game sends the arguments of what ships to create to the ships factory.
the ships factory constract the ships and return them to the game.
each ship has hp (health instance), mp (energy instance), her phisycs (SpaceShipPhysics instance),
an indicator if the shield is activated and the shot timer.
the other ships is only emplemnting diferently the doAction method.

=============================
drunk ship - the ship has a pilot that's brave deep down but has turned to alcohol lately,
 so nowadays you'll find him drunk most of the time. Every time he teleports you may notice he'll
 sober up for a while. While he's drunk he has little control over his ship and he'll fly quite randomly.
 But make no mistake, even if he's drunk, if he aims his gun at you- he won't hesitate to fire.
 
 
Special Ship - We're talking about the elite fighters of the galaxy, and they'll do anything to defend
 their homeland. With the top most technology available for them, they're able to double their amount of energy.
 They'll shoot at you non-stop, and collide into you, with their activated shields, in a deadly manner.
 If you ran into one of these ships, I hope you left a letter for you loved ones, because your chances of escape are slim.
