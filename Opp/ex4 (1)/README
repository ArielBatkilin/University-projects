LinkedListWrapper.java - A wrapper for the linked lists i use in open hash sets
SimpleHashSet.java - An abstract class for hash sets
OpenHashSet.java - Class for open hashs sets
ClosedHashSet.java - Class for closed hashs sets
CollectionFacedeSet.java - Faced for general collections.

=============================
1. I implemented the open hash set class using a wrapper for linked lists. In the class there is an array of linked lists,
 all the strings that have the same clamp is going inside the linked list at the calmp place.
 
2. At the closed hashing i delete strings by searching them first at my array(by the formula),
and after removing them i put insted of them a special string. That special string helps me determine if a cell was
 ocupid before, so i can continue searching when i look for some string.
 
 1. the open hash do bad job if every thing is going to one cell.
