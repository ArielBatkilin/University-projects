filter packege - a factory of filters, interface of filters, and alot of filters
orders packege - a factory of orders, interface of orders, and some kinds of orders
parser - class for parsing the command file
type one exeptions - class for representing type one errors
type two exeptions - class for representing type two errors
section - section made from filter, order and number of error if ther were
Directory Processor - the main class that runs the program

= Design =
=============================
1. i decided to build an interface for all the filters and orders that contain a function that relevant for them, then i made a factory of
	each one of them, the main func using the parser to create an array of sections, each section contain filter, order and the error if ocured 
	in that section. 
	
2. If i had an exeption during the creating of the filters or the order i took the exeption up till the parser, in the parser i 
	could add the line number of the exception to the section and create a default filter or or order.
	type two exeption handeld at the main func.
	
3. i build the orders as comperators. each order is a comepator object and with that i can sort easyly.
