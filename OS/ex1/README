Assignment 1:

After downloading and running the program using strace, we noticed that we should give an argument as input.
After running the program using strace with an argument we dicoverd that the program welcome us to the course and
tells us to go and read the course guidelines now!!!
("If you haven't read the course guidelines yet --- do it right now!")


In more details,The program create a directory named "Welcome" (mkdir("Welcome", 0775) = 0),
Then it make a sub-directory named "To" Then it creates a file called "OS2020" only for writing
and returns its address(openat(AT_FDCWD, "Welcome/To/OS2020", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666) = 3).
Then it opens the file and then write the following massage:
---------------------------
nir.vaknin
If you haven't read the course guidelines yet --- do it right now!
nir
---------------------------
afterwards the program closes the file, deletes the file, and deletes the sub-directory and directory
called "To" ,"Welcome". after it does, it terminates.
