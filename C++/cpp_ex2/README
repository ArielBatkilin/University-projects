In this exercise we build a program that draws fractals.
we practiced "the rule of 5", the "explicit", inharitance and 
abstraction.
For the oop i created a factory that creates the fractals for me.
i have a parent abstract class "fractal" and the childes are the
different kinds of fractals.
the factory creates a pointer of fractal that points on my spcific 
fractals. This pointers i put inside of a stack (because we want to print 
in reverse order of getting them). 
I made the move constructor and the move operator only for practicing 
even it wasn't neccery in this exercise.
